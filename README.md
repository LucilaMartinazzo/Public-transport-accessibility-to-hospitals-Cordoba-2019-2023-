# Public transport accessibility to hospitals in Córdoba (2019-2023)
A comparative analysis of potential accessibility to hospitals before (2019), during (2021), and after the pandemic (2022-2023).

## Abstract

The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the mobility restrictions governments imposed to prevent its spread changed the cities’ ways of living. Transport systems suffered the consequences of the falling travel demand, and readjustments were made in many cities to prevent the complete shutdown of services. In Córdoba, the second largest city in Argentina, the Municipality dictated route cuts and reduced frequencies to sustain the buses and trolleys system. In 2022, Martinazzo and Falavigna assessed potential accessibility to hospitals before (2019) and during the pandemic (2021). Overall, the study indicated that average travel times increased by 20% and that the gap between less vulnerable and more vulnerable population quintiles reached almost 8 points. In this paper, potential accessibility to public hospitals in 2022 and 2023 is calculated using Martinazzo and Falavigna’s (2022) work as a baseline to compare, considering that neither cutting the services during the pandemic nor recovering the service after the pandemic the Municipality performed an accessibility assessment. The main results showed that, despite the system having almost recovered its extension by 2023, it maintained the regressive tendency between less vulnerable and more vulnerable population quintiles, as the difference in average travel time between these two groups reached up to 14 min, while the cumulative opportunities measure for the high-income groups was up to 68% higher than the most vulnerable households.
